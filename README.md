# python-calculator
This is a simple calculator app written in Python. The most noteable features of the calculator are the games that it can run. The calculator has a game of snake built in, and also allows you to run the gameboy version of pokemon if you have a gameboy rom named `pokemon.gb` in the same directory. The rom isn't included due to copyright issues.
